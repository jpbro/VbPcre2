Some people when confronted with a problem, a regular expression library, and a need for access to said library in VB6 think "I know I'll write a wrapper for PCRE2 in VB6". Now they have three problems :)

The primary goal of this project is to have a comprehensive wrapper for PCRE2 in an ActiveX DLL for use in VB6 or other COM supporting languages.

The secondary goal of this project is to be a drop-in replacement for the VBSscript RegExp object.
